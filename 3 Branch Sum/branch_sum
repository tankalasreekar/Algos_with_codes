To find the branch sums of all the branches of the binary tree

Inputs: BST

Procedure:
(Recursive Approach)

1. Starting at the root node with a variable running sum equal to zero
2. Following the depth first approach to traverse through the branches of the BST
3. At every level of the tree we calculate the running sum upto that node and pass the sum along with the side branch of the tree to the recursive function
4. The recursion continues until the leaves of the tree and returns the branch sum at the leaf
